# Read this !!!
There are two versions of this web app depending on what rules you want to use for the event.

The "main" branch has it so that if you check the answers and they are wrong, it will display the number of X's the contestant has (like Family Feud). After three mistakes, it will automatically reveal all the facts. This is good for if you have teams and one category per team.

The "Dec-2021" branch has it so that checking incorrect answers will not display any X's, and will not automatically reveal the facts. This is good for if you are doing it more like the TV show, where you pull someone up to the stage and they play until they get 3 strikes, upon which they step down and you bring someone else up to continue where they left off.

You can choose which version you want to download by selecting the branch in the dropdown to the far far left of the green Code button. If you want to make any changes for a different rule set besides these, feel free to reach out; see the contact section of the director's guide.
