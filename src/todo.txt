In order of priority:
  > Cosmetic stuff 
	- Background needs to fade away from red before switching to next round because the group gets one life.
	- Put lives to right of fact lists
	- Only add mistake to right when clicking away from fade out animation
  > Next group and next round should be separated far away from eachother.

Errors:
  > Sometimes hitting nextRound or nextGroup when no facts are in the finalFacts column makes the background flash red
